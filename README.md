I am David Bellerose and have made the transition into pursuing a career as a Full Stack Web Developer. I have completed the Coder Foundry self-paced course for the ASP.NET C# framework.
I really enjoy creating full stack web applications based on relational databases using SQL. Please see below for my social links and my portfolio of projects.
